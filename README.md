# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is the use of engineering principles and applications to develop and maintain  software systems, its importance is its enablement into creation of versatile softwares that power up various aspects of modern day to day life including transport, commerce, communication etc 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages : ie C, Fortran
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements Gathering : This is the initial stage of software design where information and requirements are gathered to determine the course of the software intended
- Design : This is the architecture designing of the software
- Implementation : This phase involves writing code of the desired software application 
- Testing : This includes testing the quality standards of the software and the functionality of the application
- Deployment: This is the release of the software  to the users/customer for their use
- Maintenance: This is the support and enhancements offered to ensure a high software quality 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 - Waterfall : This involves  a sequential, waterfall approach , example : Requirements gathering, design, implementation etc 
 - Agile : This involves an incremental approach focused on collaboration, flexibility and response to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 - Software Developer: Responsible to writing code of the software system
 - Quality Assurance Engineer : Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans 
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of the software project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) : These are environments used to write code, debug and test codes, examples : VisualCode, Eclipse
 - Version Control Systems (VCS) : These are tools used to track changes of the source code and coordinate collaboration among team members , examples : GIT, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 - Changing Requirements: changing of scope by the user thus project delays
 - Tight Deadlines: Requirement to submit over a short period of time hence rushing thus a compromised quality
 - Technical Debts: These are accrued from suboptimal solutions or shortcuts
 -- Solutions: Reassessment of project scope and timelines, use of agile methodologies, effective communication

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 - Unit testing : This is the testing done to modules in the software
- Integration Testing : This is the interaction test between components of the software system
- Acceptance Testing : This is the test against user requirements to ensure a software meets the user needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 - This is the crafting of questions to get best possible responses from AI models
 - Importance : ensures clarity and specific for the AI to better understand the question

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt : Name mountains in the world?
 - Improved Prompt : List the various extinct volcanic mountains in Africa?
 - Explanation : The prompt is clear and specific to my request thus the expected answer will be clear
